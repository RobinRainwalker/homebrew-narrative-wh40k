# Homebrew Rules for Underhive Crusade
Uses the Crusade rules, with the additional rules below.

# Your Army
Supply Limit: To start with: 500pts OR 25PL depending on player choice

# Underhive Rules
_Game Size_: Before starting the game, select the grid size based on the number of players. Then randomly generate which Territory exists within each grid slot by alternating between Terrain List One, and Terrain List two. Players may also agree on which Territories go where. Players then pick their starting Territory, which must border the edge of the grid. No player may select a starting Territory next to a Territory controlled by another player. 
2 Players: 2x3 grid
3 Players: 3x3 grid
4 Players: 4x4 grid
For each additional player, increase either the rows or the columns by one. 

_Phases of the Game_:
    * Declare Phase: All players write down secretly which Territory they are going to attempt to claim
    * Battle Phase: Resolve these in order, each player either simply claiming the Territory if it is unoccupied, or playing a match against the player who owns that Territory.
      * Resolution & Resources Phase: At the end of each player's Battle Phase, resolve the post match rules. Then the Attacker resolves the amount of resources gained, and may spend their resources as well. 

_Defender's Advantage_: Select the missions as per Crusade rules. However, whoever is the owner of the Terrain being fought over is the Defender, and selects which side they will deploy from unless otherwise stated.

_Height Advantage_: A model gains a height advantage when it is over 3" in height above the targeted unit. Height advantage grants an additional AP for all ranged weapons for that attack. 

_Daring Leap_: In the Movement phase, when making a normal move with an INFANTRY , BEAST or MONSTER model that is on a terrain piece and not on the ground floor, you can measure directly to another point of equal or lower height when determining the distance moved, if you do so the unit may not advance this turn. After doing so, roll one D6 for each model in the unit; on a 1, that model suffers 1 mortal wound.


# Resources

    * At the end of each Turn, gain 1 Reputation for each Territory under your Army's control
    * At the end of each Turn, gain 1 Reputation for every 15 unit destroyed tallies amongst all units you control

_Territories_: acquired through battles within that terrain
    * Territory Special: Acquired Territories generate specific bonuses to the Army that controls the Territory, only so long as that Territory remains in control of that Army
  
_Requisition Points_: Based on battle results, using crusade rules from 9th ed.

_Coin_: Gained based on Territory Specials
    * Used to purchase additional Requisition points (1000 Coin for 1 Requisition point)
    * Used to purchase Strategy points (15 Coin for 1 Strategy point)

_Strategy Points_: Strategy points are spent only on Territories you control
1)  Buy Fortifications
    * 2 Strategy points can be used to buy 25 points worth of Fortifications that remain only in that Territory
      * These points stack over multiple turns, and should be noted in the Territory notes. When enough points have been acumulated to buy a particular Fortification, the controlling Army may spend those points that have been saved to buy it and it can be placed during the next battle setup. 
    * Like all Terrain in a Territory, it does not move from the initial placement.
    * These Fortifications follow the rules for the Army controlling the Territory
    * When a Territory with Fortifications changes which Army controls it, those Fortifications are then destroyed
    * A maximum of 15 Points of Fortifications are allowed per Territory
2) Buy Booby Traps
  * Spend 2 Strategy point for Booby Traps. They last for only one Battle.
    * Booby Traps: After Terrain has been determined for a battle and sides have been determined, select 3 Booby Trap tokens, 2 with a blank side down, and 1 with a Mine symbol. Place the 3 Booby Trap tokens on the battlefield more than 9" from any battlefield edge. When an enemy unit moves within 3" of a Booby Trap token, flip it over. If it has the Mine symbol, Roll 3d6, and for each 3+, the enemy unit suffers one wound that may be saved, although it ignores cover. 
    * For each additional Booby Trap bought for a given battle, place one extra Trapped token face down on the battlefield.
3) Additional CP
   * Spend 3 Strategy points to gain one additional CP for the next Battle, it does not carry over to subsequent Battles.
4) Modify Terrain 
      * Modified Terrain remains as modified, even if the Territory changes hands
   * Spend 1 Strategy point to add, remove, or change one Terrain trait in that Territory you control. 
   * Spend 5 Strategy points to change one Terrain feature for another, or to move one existing Terrain feature to somewhere else on the battlefield (this can include Fortifications)
