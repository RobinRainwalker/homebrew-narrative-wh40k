# Underhive Crusade
This is a homebrew addon to the Warhammer 40k Narrative Crusade. 

Inspired by Necromunda's territory and out of battle money system to create an underhive vibe for ~500-1000pt armies armies. The core idea is that Terrain has become a huge part of 9th ed Warhammer, so you capture territories (maps) and once a map has been played on, it stays the same for future battles in that territory - and you can use the out of battle currency from territories you own to permanently alter map terrain and add fortifications, in addition to some terrains having other effects. 

[[homebrew_underhive]] is where the rules reside

The first_playtest folder is a 12 army playtest on a 7x7 grid because I need to balance things more and an excess of different armies will help
[[map]] is just an ASCII art map to determine which armies control which territories

If some of the stuff seems weird that's because it's based on foam-bubble repo that's for enhanced note taking, and allows me to pull and work off of any computer
